# Interactive Bar Chart

This project demonstrates an **Interactive Bar Chart** built using **Vue.js**, **Chart.js**, and **JSON data**. The chart visualizes three variables: `Products`, `Total Sales`, and `Total Value`, offering an intuitive, user-friendly, and dynamic experience.

## 🌟 Features
- **Dynamic and Interactive Visualization**:
  - Displays products along the x-axis.
  - Shows the total sales as bar heights.
  - Uses a color gradient to represent total value, enhanced with a color scale.
  - Interactive tooltips for detailed data insights.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Optimized for different screen sizes for seamless viewing.

- **Dataset Transformation**:
  - The dataset was provided in Excel (`.xlsx`) format, converted into JSON for integration into the bar chart.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Vue.js**: For creating the frontend framework.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering the bar chart and adding interactive capabilities.
- **JSON Data**: To manage the dataset efficiently.

## 📊 Chart Details
- **X-Axis**: Represents `Products`.
- **Y-Axis**: Represents `Total Sales`.
- **Color Gradient**: Encodes `Total Value` from light to dark shades.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Data Conversion**: The original `.xlsx` dataset was converted to JSON format for smooth integration.
2. **Chart Rendering**: Chart.js was utilized to create a visually appealing and interactive chart.
3. **Interactivity**: Tooltips display data details dynamically on hover.
